# 🏥OPENCLINIC

This is a project that I (João Oliveira) made for studying Spring Boot principles. 🚀
The goal is to make an system for a health care clinic that patients can schedule appointments based on schedule calendars of the medics, attendants can serve patients who have scheduled appointments beforehand or want to do that(if there are medics with open schedules), and medics can put their schedule for attending patients with the possibility to cancel an attend at any time. 

The following diagram shows the initial class model for the project.

class Person{
	-string name
	-string cpf	
	-date birthDate
}

class Medic{
	-string CRM
	-string type
}

class Patient{
	-string membershipId
}

class Attendant{
	-int ticketWindow
}

class Schedule{
	-int month
	-int year
}

class TicketAttendanceRecord{
	-Ticket ticket
	-Attendant attendant
	-TicketStatus status
}

class TicketQueue{
	-List<Ticket> generatedTickets
	+generateTicket(TicketPriority priority, int lastTicketNum) : Ticket
	+callNextTicket(): Ticket
}

class Ticket{
	-int ticketNum
	+ticketCode(): String
}

class TicketPriority{
	<<enumeration>>
	NORMAL
	PREFERENTIAL
	EXAM_RESULTS
}

class TicketStatus{
	<<enumeration>>
	WAITING_ATTENDANT
	WAITING_APPOINTMENT
	UNREDEEMED
	SERVED
}

class Appointment{
	-date appointmentDate
	-LocalTime appointmentTime
}

class AppointmentStatus{
	<<enumeration>>
	OPEN
	SCHEDULED
	DONE
	CANCELLED
	ABSENT_PATIENT	
}

Person <-- Medic
Person <-- Patient
Person <-- Attendant

Medic "1" *.. "1" Schedule: Opened by
Medic "*" --> "0..1" TicketQueue 

Ticket "1" ..* "0..*" TicketQueue: Generated by
Ticket <.. TicketPriority
Ticket <.. TicketStatus

Patient "0..*" <-- "0..1" Appointment: Makes an appointment
Attendant --> TicketAttendanceRecord: Records when a attendant gets a ticket
Ticket --> TicketAttendanceRecord
TicketAttendanceRecord <.. TicketStatus

Appointment "1" <.. "1..*" Schedule: Monthly generated, decided by the owner of the Schedule

AppointmentStatus ..> Appointment
```

This model can change, I will update it based on RFCs on the [docs](/docs) folder.
