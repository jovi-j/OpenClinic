# RFC #002 - Possible changes in the Appointment model
### Author: Jovi

# Context
The model does not have an period range to inform at which time the appointments 
ends, but on second thought, similar systems like the one used at the Unimed
health care system does not inform it either, just an estimate time to be attended.

So, to be more simple, i will only inform at which time the appointment begins.
